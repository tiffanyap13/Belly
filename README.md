# Belly Button Biodiversity 
The goal of this project was to create visualization of the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers, upon selection of their respective ID from the dropdown, can view their top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons which is highlighted by a bar chart.  Further there is a gauge which reveals the number of washings per week and also a bubble chart which reveals the bacterial cultures per sample.
